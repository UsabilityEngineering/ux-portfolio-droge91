I enjoy playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate on my pc using an emulator called Ryujinx.  Playing on an emulator naturally allows for greater control and customization, but anyone who has actually tried to install mods on an emulator can tell you that doing so is a daunting task.  
This is where Quasar comes in, quasar is an application capable of installing modifications for you once provided the path to your emulators folder.  Here you can see the applications home screen
